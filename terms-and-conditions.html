      Minimal CSS for header sticky positioning and fade-out animation.
      All other styles (colors, fonts, layout, etc.) should be in ../styles.css
    */

    /* Styles for the header element to be sticky and allow animation */
    header#pageHeader {
      position: sticky; /* Makes the header stick to the top of the viewport */
      top: 0; /* Aligns the sticky header to the top */
      z-index: 1000; /* Ensures the header stays on top of other content */
      transition: opacity 0.5s ease-out, transform 0.5s ease-out; /* Smooth transition for the fade and movement */
      /*
        NOTE: Background color, padding, text alignment, borders, box-shadow, etc.,
        for the header should be defined in your ../styles.css file.
        For example, in ../styles.css you might have:
        header#pageHeader {
          background-color: white;
          padding: 1rem 2rem;
          text-align: center;
          border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
        }
      */
    }

    /* CSS class to apply the fade-out effect */
    .header-fade-out {
      opacity: 0; /* Makes the header transparent */
      transform: translateY(-20px); /* Optional: slight upward movement during fade-out */
      pointer-events: none; /* Prevents interaction with the invisible header */
    }

    /*
      NOTE: Styles for h1, p within the header, main content, footer, body, etc.,
      should be defined in your ../styles.css file.
      For example, in ../styles.css:
      body {
        font-family: sans-serif;
        margin: 0;
      }
      main {
        max-width: 800px;

        padding: 1rem;
      }
      header#pageHeader h1 {
        font-size: 2rem;
        margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
      }
