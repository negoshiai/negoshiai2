    <h2>7-Day Satisfaction Guarantee</h2>
    <p>We stand behind our services. If, for any reason, you are not fully satisfied with your purchase, please contact our support team within **7 days** from the date of your initial purchase. To request a refund, please provide detailed information about the issue you are experiencing and any relevant order details.</p>

    <h2>Refund Process</h2>
    <p>Once your refund request is received and reviewed by our team, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If your refund is approved, it will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment within **5 to 10 business days**. Please note that the processing time can vary depending on your payment provider.</p>

    <h2>Conditions for Refund</h2>
    <p>While we strive to be fair, certain conditions apply to our refund policy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Refund requests must be submitted within the specified 7-day period.</li>
      <li>We may require you to provide sufficient evidence of the issue for which you are requesting a refund.</li>
      <li>Refunds may not be granted if the issue is due to misuse of our services or if you have violated our Terms & Conditions.</li>
      <li>For subscription-based services, refunds are typically only provided for the most recent billing cycle and are not provided for past usage.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to offer a service credit or alternative resolution instead of a monetary refund at our discretion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Denial of Refund Requests</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to deny refund requests if they do not meet our policy criteria, including but not limited to requests made after the 7-day period, lack of sufficient evidence of an issue, or violation of our terms of service.</p>
